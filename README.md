# Day Planner
## Task:
```
Create a day planner where event can be saved for each hour of the day.
```
## User Story
```
With this day planner I modified code to set events throughout the hours of a normal business day.
The user will be able to store these events and view them whenever they would like, as long as the event is saved.
The user will be able to edit and save the data as they would like.
The daily planner will let the user know which hour is past, present or future.
This will help any user stay organized and keep track of their day.
